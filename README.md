# Introduction 
FlowR is a .NET framework for building process flows based on a series of decoupled exchanges. It leverages the MediatR framework and dependency injection to enable such flows to be defined in a declarative fashion. The result are process flows that can be tested in a straightfoward manner and produce comprehensive logging as standard.
